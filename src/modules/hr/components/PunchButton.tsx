/**
 * The attendance control, in the top bar.
 *
 * Lives in the shell, not on a page: it is the first and last thing someone
 * touches each day, and burying it behind navigation guarantees forgotten
 * punch-outs — the one attendance event that costs an admin work to fix.
 *
 * Two wording rules, both easy to undo by accident:
 *
 * - **The label states the next action, not the current state.** "Punch out"
 *   means pressing it punches you out. "Punched in" would read as a status
 *   display and get ignored.
 * - **"Punch", never "log".** The account menu on the same bar has a "Log out"
 *   that ends the session. Two controls reading alike and doing different
 *   things is a mis-click, and the accidental one closes a shift.
